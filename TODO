- Math:
  * Optimize div in N / uint in enum comp / ulong?
  * Profile: OtherRegular, Other7 (MinDaysInMonth >= 7)?
  * Move standard ops (on CalendarMonth) from Math to Arithmetic.
    Problem: optimization of AddMonths() and Count...() depending on the profile.
    For regular schema, it's fine, but for lunisolar schema?
  * PlainMath, tests for ordinal dates.
  * API for CalendarDay (PlusYears, PlusMonths?), humm no, use conversion to
    CalendarDate. We have the three forms of dates for that purpose.
- Tests should not perform any conversion, e.g. CalendarDate -> OrdinalDate.

- Packaging: version numbering (timestamp).
- Publication: GitHub & NuGet (for NuGet only when reach 1.0.0).
- When .NET 7 is out:
  D.B.targets: disable preview features.
  Clean up unnecessary "#pragma warning disable".
  Generic math: using System.Numerics.
  Github action: test on Ubuntu and MacOS.
- Clean up compiler symbols.
- CLSCompliant
- Exception messages: use ThrowHelpers.
  Only use OverflowException for truely arithmetic overflows?
  XML doc: "would", "was"
- Era type as a range of DayNumber's.
- ISpanFormattable
- Clean up DIM.
  Beware of DIM and structs.

Plan?
-----

### Version 1.0
- Stable API and full test coverage.
  * Complete Core
  * At least one Lunisolar calendar (Hebrew)
  * At least one leap week calendar (ISO & Pax)
- XML doc/comments: currently largely outdated or badly written.
- .NET 7, we use preview features

### Version 1.x
- Geometry
- Hemerology

### Version 2.x
- Horology

### Misc
- Eras, an era is a named range of day numbers. Relation to scopes & calendars?
- Day scales, moment, epoch
  Julian Day, Modified Julian Day
- Time scales: TAI, TT, UTC
- Religious calendars, liturgical calendars, computus
- Regnal calendars or (better?) dates
- Hybrid calendars or better?) dates, Gregorianizer
- Fictional calendars based on IAffineDate

À classer
---------

Nychthemeron is part of the jargon of calendar studies, it is
a period of 24 consecutive hours. In a uniform time scale, like TAI,
TT or UT1, it is equivalent to a period of 86,400 consecutive seconds.
In this context, it is rather a definition since the second is the
base unit. In a non-uniform time scale, like UTC, there is not such
thing as a nychthemeron --- one could argue that there is not one
but many kinds of nychthemerons. This is not really a concern for
what we have in mind here. We define a nychthemeron to be a period
of time spanning from midnight of one day to the onset of the
following day. The property `DaysSinceEpoch` is then the
number of consecutive nychthemerons from midnight of the epoch of
the calendar to midnight of the current instance.

- alt arith: see date4j.net, https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J
- Formatting: short, long, ISO, format, culture-dependent variants. Parsing,
  `IFormattable`.
- Serialization: `Serializable`, `IXmlSerializable`, `FromBinary`, `ToBinary`.
- F# & VB.NET: out params are difficult to use, `end` is a reserved keywords.
  Custom methods: value tuples and `Option<>`.
- Can method with out params be inlined? (see DOES_NOT_RETURN in second ref)

Covariant return type does not work when a property (Arithmetic here),
is a property from an interface or has a setter.

abstract override

Simply use a ValueTuple instead?
